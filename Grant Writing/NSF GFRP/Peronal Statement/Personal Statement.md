## 2018 NSF-GFRP PERSONAL STATEMENT:

P. Alexander Burnham

September 3, 2017



Amongst my grandfather's repertoire of rural proverbs and provincial wisdom was a funny little saying that has stuck with me. "You can't get there from here." It may have been something he heard growing up in the country side of Massachusetts or from his time as a dentist in the farm land of Southern Vermont. Its origin aside, it became one of those phrases that my family would repeat around a campfire, usually in an exaggerated version of my grandfather's accent. It was probably originally intended as a statement of the obvious to the directional impaired (like myself), but it has resonated with me as somewhat of a challenge. Why can't you get there from here? 

The best laid plans are the ones that are the most flexible because in my opinion, and contrary to the traditional proverb, "there" is always just a stop on the road to "here."

I grew up in rural Southern Vermont.
