## My Esteemed Colleague

## Why are we interested in bees?


* Pollinators are responsible for between $235-577 billion (estimated) in agricultural revinue world wide.

* Around 30% of all food and 75% of the words most important food stuffs require animal-mediated pollination 

* The majority of these services are provided by bees

* Pollination services provided by honeybees are responsible for $14 billion (USD) annually in US commercial agriculture.

## We know our bees are in decline.

* Honeybee overwintering losses are higher (40% losses on average)

* Colonoy Collapse Dissorder (CCD)

* Introduction of parasites and pathogens that were not problematic before

## Native pollinators, like bumblebees, are very important too.

* Bumblebees are capable of buzz pollination
      + Tomatoes
      + Squash
      + Blueberries
* Important to native angiosperms 
* Relitive to honeybees, bumblebees are understudied

## Bumblebees are in decline as well.

* There has been a decrease in abundance since the 1960s:
      + _B. affinis_
      + _B. borealis_
      + _B. ashtoni_
      + _B. fervidus_ 
      + _B. pensylvanicus_ 
      + _B. sandersoni_
* In 2015, three bumblebees were listed in Vermont
      + _B. affinis_ (Endangered)
      + _B. ashtoni_ (Endangered)
      + _B. terricola_ (Threatened)
      
## _Bombus affinis_

## _Nosema spp._

## Nosema

* Nosema is a microsporidian 

* Fecal/Oral Transmission

* Lives in the ventriculus of the bee

* There are two species that affect bumblebees
      + _N. bombi_
      + _N. ceranae_


## What does it do to the bees it infects?

* Decreased foraging effciency 

* Dysentery in heavily infected bees 

* And death if the infection reaches high levels before natural death

## What did I want to find out?

* This is an understudied disease system in bumblebees.

* How prevalent is this parasite?

* Does it have any preferences in who it infects?

* What is the dynamic of this disease system on a large scale?

## Hypotheses:

* H1:     Species that build larger colonies will have a higher probability of infection than those that build smaller.

* H2:     Workers will have a higher probability of infection than other castes.

* H3:     Bumblebee colonies adjacent to honeybee apiaries will have a higher probability of infection. 

## Methods:

## 2014 _Bombus_ Survey

* In 2014 we conducted a bumblebee survey in Northern Vermont.

* We collected over 300 specimines 
      + all three castes
      + random sampling 
      + 8 different species
      
* Vegatation and bee abundance surveys at each site

* Collected from Honeybee yards as well as sites with few honeybees

## Nosema Counts:

* The bees were disected (ventriculus removed)

* Homogenized in 500uL of GITC buffer

* Counts were made for each bee using a hemocytometer.

## How does this disease system work?

###Modeling the System

## Bombus life history:

## The Model

![alt text](http://i966.photobucket.com/albums/ae147/alexburn17/CE10_zpstajjl7j3.png)


## Differential Equations for Nosema Model MKII 

$$ \frac{dS}{dt} = {-S}{P}{}{\beta} - {S}{\mu_A} $$
$$ \frac{dI_1}{dt} = {S}{P}{\beta} - {I_1}{\mu_A} - {I_1}{\gamma} $$
$$ \frac{dI_2}{dt} = {I_1}{P}{\gamma} - {I_2}{\mu_B} $$
$$ \frac{dP}{dt} = {I_1}{\alpha_1}+ {I_2}{\alpha_2} - {P}{\theta} $$

## What is the purpose of this Model?

* It is not an exact representation of the system but...

* It helps us to better understand the players involved and the dynamics betwen them within the system

* helps us to discover what are the right questions to be asking

## To Summerize

* H1:     Species that build larger colonies will have a higher probability of infection than those that build smaller. __(NO)__

* H2:     Workers will have a higher probability of infection than other castes. __(NO)__

* H3:     Bumblebee colonies adjacent to honeybee apiaries will have a higher probability of infection. __(NO)__

## How can we interpret this?

* Nosema is ubiquitous in Vermont bumblebee populations now

* This could indicate a higher likelihood of coinfection wit other pathogens

* The model helps us to understand this dynamic system and showes us the question we should be asking 

## What is in store for the future?
