I believe the most important skills and attributes for this position are the abilities to be both a good listener and provide first hand experience as an active member in the Biology department. As someone who is both approachable and of a comparable age, I believe I can use these skills to listen to and understand any concerns my mentee might have, and respond with an answer derrived from personal expierience.


I defused a heated argument in a recording studio as a band leader by allieviating the stress of the situation with a light-hearted joke and recomending a break from the work at hand. This had the desired effect and after the break all parties made up and the session continued succesfully. I would handle a simialer situation in the same way now.


I believe one of the biggest challenges facing the college of arts and sciences (especially the biology department) is the low faculty to student ratio. I believe this program will help alleviate this issue.


My goals as a mentor are to improve my mentee's expierence at UVM and in the Biology department. I hope to be able to help him or her to get the most out of a good education in biology. At the same time, I hope to gain valuable mentoring and teaching experience. I hope to achieve this by having an opendoor policy where I am always available to help and address any worries or concerns.
