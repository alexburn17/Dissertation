**Over-arching goals:**

1) To further the fields of epidemiology and disease ecology 

2) To further bee conservation efforts by increasing our understanding of how bee diseases spread and interact



**Aims:**

**Chapter 1:** 

1) to survey pathogens through time (empirical measures of nature)

2) analysis patterns of coinfection through time

* Sygerism could be responsible for increased coinfection between two pathogens
* increases in confection could be driven by temporal variation



* Figure 1 Temporal Variation 



**Chapter 2:**

1) Test proposed viral transmission route 

2) Collect paramaters from experiments 

3) parameterize CA model and examine floral diversity's role (dilution hypothesis)

* Paramaters
  * dosage to replicating infection
  * virus picked up ~ foraging time
  * proportion of flowers infected
  * amount of virus on flowers



* Figure 2 Dilution Graphs



**Chapter 3:**

1) demonstrate how pathogens interact within the host 

2) model coinfection and how it might spread 

* Figure 3 Co-infection figure



**Summary:** 

In general: create a holistic model

* Figure 4 entire system diagram


I believe through these aims we can improve pollinator health and further disease research

Combining these ideas could give us a more holistic picture of how EID operates

**Ecology**

* Exponential Population Growth
  * $N=N_0e^{rt}$
    * Assumptions
      * No I or E
      * Constant B and D
      * No genetic, age or size structure
      * continuous growth with no time lags

* Logistic Population Growth

  * $\frac{dN}{dt}=rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$

    * Assumptions

      * No I or E

      * Constant B and D

      * No genetic, age or size structure

      * continuous growth with no time lags

      * linear density dependance 

      * constant carrying capacity


* Lotka-Voltera Predator-Prey
  * $\frac{dV}{dt}=rV-\alpha VP$
  * $\frac{dP}{dt}=\beta VP-qP$
    * $\alpha=$ capture efficiency 
    * $\beta=$ conversion efficiency 
  * Assumptions
    * no time lags
    * no age/size/genetic structure
    * No I and E
    * V limited only by P
    * P specialist on V
    * P are insatiable 
    * random meeting on substrate



* Lotka-Voltera Competition
  * $\frac{dN_1}{dt}=r_1N_1 \Big(\frac{k_1-N_1-\alpha N_2}{k_1} \Big)$
  * $\frac{dN_2}{dt}=r_2N_2 \Big(\frac{k_2-N_2-\beta N_1}{k_2} \Big)$
  * Assumptions
    * No I and E
    * no time lags
    * no age/size/genetic structure
    * limited resources
    * constant parameter values
    * linear density dependence 



**Evolution**

* Definition of Evolution
  * Change in the allele frequencies of a population through time
* Requirements for Selection
  * Individuals exhibit variation in their traits
  * At least some of that variation has a heritable (= genetic) component
  * All individuals produce more offspring than can survive
  * Particular traits enhance survival in particular environments (relative to individuals with other traits)
* Four Horsemen of Evolution
  * Mutation
  * Genetic Drift (bottle neck)
  * Natural Selection
  * Gene Flow (I and E)
* Definition of Natural Selection
  * differential reproduction and/or survival of individuals with
    heritable traits
* Hardy-Weinberg (1 gene, 2 alleles) 
  * A null hypothesis for evolution (shows effect of no evolution)
  * $p+q=1$ (allele frequencies) 
  * $p^2 +2pq + q^2=1$ (gene frequencies) 
  * Assumptions
    * No mutation
    * No migration
    * Random mating
    * No natural selection
    * Large population size
    * Random segregation of alleles
* Kin Selection
  * Definition
* Eusociality 
  * Definition



## To Draw on Board

**SIR Model**

$\frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta I S$  

$\frac{dI}{dt}=\beta I S - \gamma I$

$\frac{dR}{dt}=\gamma I$
