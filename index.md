## P. Alexander Burnham

My interests include disease ecology, ecological modeling, statistics and pollinator conservation. I graduated from the University of Vermont with a B.S. in zoology where I began combining my interest in pollinators with my fascinations with disease and statistics. My Ph.D. work broadly focusses on understanding the interactions that occur between multiple pathogens within their host organism. I am specifically interested in how temporal variation in RNA viruses and three species of the fungal parasite, *Nosema* might influence patterns of co-infection in both native and managed bees. In addition, I hope to understand what effects competition between pathogens (as well as other forms of interspecific interaction) might have on host mortality.
