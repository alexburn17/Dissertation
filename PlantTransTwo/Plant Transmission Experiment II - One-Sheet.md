##Plant Transmission Experiment II - One-Sheet

P. Alexander Burnham & Samantha A. Alger - June 18, 2018

#### Pilot 1: (how many virus particles on wild flowers and how much to inoculate)

* standardize load (genome copies/flower) by mass (see R code in Dissertation PlantTransII Directory)
* Found to be between 200,000 and 1,000,000 genome copies per flower
* Inoculate real flowers with known dosages to determine how much for field realistic assays.
* Found to be 1:1 but give in 10uL volume 

#### Pilot 2: (test HB and Bombus colonies for DWV and BQCV)

* Pollen starve 10 to 15 bees from each colony  (3 days) and do four composite extractions and test for BQCV and DWV
* Test HB colonies for DWV and BQCV

#### Pilot 3: (orally inoculate bombus to test virus isolate) 

- pollen starve 5 bees from each colony (N=20) get inoculated with 1,000,000 genome copies of DWV
- test 4 days later

####Pilot 4: (honeybees on petals or nectaries and bombus + HB pilot) 

* 50 artificial flowers in flight cage with HB nuc.
  * Part one: 30 flowers get dissected and have nectaries and petals tested separately for DWV
  * Part two: 20 flowers are given to 20 bumble bees (pollen starved), which are tested right after to determine sample size of first exposure treatment in main experiments 

####Experiment 1: (Fake Flowers + Hand Inoculation)

* Control = 20, First Exposure = 20, Long Exposure = 60 (TOTAL = 100 bees)
* 10 uL of 100,000 spores/uL put on 80 treatments and 10uL sucrose on controls
* 120 Bombus pollen starved for 3 days

####Experiment 2: (Fake Flowers + HB Inoculation)

* Control = 20, First Exposure = 20, Long Exposure = 60 (TOTAL = 100 bees)
* 100 fake flowers given to bees in 10 groups of 10 until each flower was visited at least 5 times
* 120 Bombus pollen starved for 3 days
* Control flowers given to control bees and HB flowers given to Treatment bees
