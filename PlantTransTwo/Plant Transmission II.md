### Plant Transmission II - Experiment 1: Virus pickup experiment 

**August 14, 2018**

**General Summary:** Pollen starve 60 bees (20 control and 40 treatment) and place a field realistic dose of DWV on the treatment flowers (10 uL of 100,000 gencop/uL for a total of 1,000,000 genome copies). Allow bees to forage on flowers for set amount of time then sacrifice the bee directly after. 

**Questions:** What is the likelihood of picking up virus when visiting an infected flower? How much virus is picked up by a bee after visiting one infected flower? How many flowers need to be visited to ensure a dose that will cause infection?

**Steps:**

* Pollen starve bumble bees for three days
* Transfer bumble bees to larger containers (write colony number on colony)
* Create inoculum in correct concentration
* Label 60 eppendorf tubes 1 through 60
* Evenly spread colonies through treatments (5 of each for control and 10 of each for Treatment)
* Label 1 through 60 and T or C on big container 
* Fill flowers with sucrose and Inoculate
* put flowers in for the following seconds: (Feeders pulled at 6:55AM)
  * 1-10 (x5)
  * 11-20 (x5)
  * 21-30 (x5)
  * 31-40 (x5)
  * 41-60 (x5)
  * 61-80 (x5)
  * 81-100 (x5)
  * 101-120 (x5)
* Place bees in propper eppendorf tube and put on liquid nitrogen 
* Place the bees in the freezer
