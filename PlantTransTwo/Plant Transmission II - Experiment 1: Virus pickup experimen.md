### Plant Transmission II - Experiment 1: Virus pickup experiment

**General Summary:** Pollen starve 60 bees (20 control and 40 treatment) and place a field realistic dose of DWV on the treatment artificial flowers (10 uL of 100,000 gencop/uL for a total of 1,000,000 genome copies). Allow bees to forage on flowers for set amount of time then sacrifice the bee directly after. 

**Questions:** What is the likelihood of picking up virus when visiting an infected flower? How much virus is picked up by a bee after visiting one infected flower? How many flowers need to be visited to ensure a dose that will cause infection?

**Figures, Stats and Results:** 

* Regression of forage time and DWV load and Prevalence. 
* Scatter plot with two axises 
* Parameter estimate for virus pickup and probability of picking up virus given length of visitation. 



### Plant Transmission II - Experiment 2: Dose Curve

****

**General Summary:** Sucrose starve 60 bees (15 from each colony) and divide into four treatment groups (1mil, 3mil, 5mil and 10mil). Give each bee an oral inoculation (10uL totaling the genome copies in each treatment) and wait 4 days. Measure the prevalence of infection at each treatment and the mean viral load for each treatment. 

**Questions:** What is the probability of a replicating infection based on different intakes of DWV? How much needs to be ingested for a guaranteed infection? 

**Figures, Stats and Results:**

* Mixed Effects GLMs for DWV load and prevalence by treatment 
* Plot showing prevalence of load by treatment 
* Parameter estimates for prevalence and load based on intake



### Plant Transmission II - Experiment 3: Honey Bee Deposition  

------

**General Summary:** 

**Questions:** What is the prevalence of viral deposition on flowers? What viral load is being deposited on flowers? Is DWV deposited on the petals or nectaries?

**Figures, Stats and Results:**



### Plant Transmission II - Experiment 4: Pickup Real Flowers 

------

**General Summary:** 

**Questions:** What is the probability of picking up the virus?

**Figures, Stats and Results:**



### Plant Transmission II - Experiment 5: Full Route Real Flowers 

------

**General Summary:** 

**Questions:** 

**Figures, Stats and Results:**



### Plant Transmission II - Experiment 6: Infected Bombus on Flowers 

------

**General Summary:** Infect 20 bumble bees with 10 million genome copies and have them forage for *t* seconds on the flower. Determine viral load of flowers and bees and regress them.

**Questions:** Can infected bumble bees infect real flowers? Can bumble bee play a part in driving the transmission?

**Figures, Stats and Results:** 

* Scatter plot showing Flower Viral Load by *Bombus* viral load
* linear model between two variables
* probability that bumble bees can propagate virus on own
