To determine the amount of purified DWV virus isolate to infect our experimental flowers with, an absolute quantification qPCR experiment was conducted on composite samples of wild flowers collected near honey bee apiaries. In addition, a single flowers that were positive for BQCV, a similar RNA viruses were also assayed. Viral loads in genome copies per flower were calculated by diluting extracted RNA to a constant concentration and normalizing by flower mass. It was determined that the composite samples carried a maximum DWV load of 700,000 genome copies per gram of flower material and the single flowers had a maximum BQCV load of 200,000 genome copies per flower. An acceptable realistic range was then determined to be between 100,000 and 1,000,000 genome copies per flower. In order to test our inoculation protocol on real flowers, 10uL of 100,000 copies/uL active virus solution were placed inside the nectaries of a 4 flowers. We conducted absolute quantification qPCR experiment on the flowers as described for the collected wild flowers with a mean of ~1,000,000 copies per flower detected.
