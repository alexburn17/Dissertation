# Stream Diversity Lab - Field Notes

September 28, 2017



*The purpose of this lab is to quantify the taxonomic diversity of aquatic invertebrate communities that live in Vermont streams and examine what factors within the stream might influence biodiversity.*

**Biodiversity:**  is a broad term that can refer to the diversity of genes, species, traits, and ecosystem functions in an area. Taxonomic diversity takes into account both the number and abundance of different taxa living in an area. 

**Biotic vs Abiotic factors:** 

* The living things in an ecosystem are called biotic factors. 
  * Living things include plants, animals, bacteria, fungi and more. 
* The non living parts of an ecosystem are called abiotic factors. 
  * some abiotic factors are **sunlight**,**temperature atmospheric** gases **water** and **soil**.

​			
**Measurements of Bio Diversity:**

* Species Richness: refers to the total number of taxa in the community. 

* Species Density: is the number of species per sampling unit or area.

* Species Evenness is the distribution of relative abundances for the species in an area or sample. If the
  distribution is perfectly even, then each species has an equal abundance.

  * we use PIE to estimate this
  * ​


  **Our question: Is there an effect of sunlight on micro-invertebrate biodiversity?**  		
  ​	

**Materials:**
• Serber sampler
• meter stick
• ping pong ball
• sample sorter tray
• forceps
• 3mL pipette tips (cut tip)
• Invertebrate Key: You will identify organisms to Order. (book and dichotomous key)
• rock sponge
• gloves if needed

**Groups of 4**

* each table is a group

**Operations**

* 6 sites (3 shade and 3 sunlight

  * measure depth and water speed for each

* Collect using serber sampler standardized methods in lab manual

* ID organisms to **Order** for each site (at least 30 per collection)
